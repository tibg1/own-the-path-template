# 🛤️ OwnThePath – Your Personal Mission Brief

Welcome to your launchpad. This is your **digital space to discover who you are, explore what excites you, and build a future you're proud of**.

You're not here to get graded. You're here to grow.

## ✨ What Is This?

This GitHub repo is **your home base** for:

- Tracking your goals

## 👋 Welcome to the Team

This isn't school.  
This is your *real* portfolio. Everything you build here stays with you—college apps, job interviews, personal brand, all of it.

Your GitHub repo is your space. You’ll use it to track growth, experiment, and document what you’re into.

Let’s keep it simple to start:

---

## ✅ Your First Assignment – *Define Your Direction*

1. **Clone your repo**
   - Use the `getting-started` template from `VidalFamilyWorks`
   - Rename it with your GitHub username

2. **Fill in the README**
   - Write 2–3 sentences about yourself  
   - Add a line for what you're currently curious about (editing, coding, games, AI, etc.)

3. **Take a quick career interest quiz**  
   - [Take this quiz](https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip)  
   - Screenshot your results  
   - Upload it to the `/assignments/01-intro` folder

4. **Push it all to GitHub**
   - Commit, push, and check your repo online
   - DM me when it's up

## 📍 What's Next

Based on what you write, you'll start getting:
- Skill-building resources
- Small projects tailored to you
- A roadmap to track where you're going

No pressure. Just progress.
